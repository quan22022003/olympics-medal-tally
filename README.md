# Olympics Project

This project is an implementation of a system that tracks the Olympic medals of different nations. It provides functionality to add nations, add medals to nations, and display the medal standings. The project supports an arbitrary number of nations and allows for saving and loading data from a file.

## Commands

The system supports the following commands:

- **Add nation**: Adds a nation to the database.
- **Add medals**: Adds medals to a specific nation.
- **Print database**: Displays the medal standings.
- **Save to file**: Saves the database to a text file.
- **Load from file**: Loads data from a text file into the database.
- **Quit program**: Exits the program.

Please refer to the [Project Description](#olympics-project) for detailed information about the commands and their usage.
